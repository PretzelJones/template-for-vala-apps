# Standard Application Model Vala for elementary OS

## Building, Testing, and Installation

You'll need the following dependencies:
* cmake
* [cmake-elementary](https://code.launchpad.net/~elementary-os/+junk/cmake-modules)
* libgranite-dev
* libgtk-3-dev
* valac (>= 0.26)

It's recommended to create a clean build environment

    mkdir build
    cd build/
    
Run `cmake` to configure the build environment and then `make` to build

    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
    make
    
To install, use `make install`, then execute

    sudo make install
    ./Hello
